# Modeling-Covid
This project is modeling the regional spread of Covid-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals. Using Ordinary Differential Equations and their ability to model subpopulation dynamics, we built an SAIRD (Susceptible, Asymptomatic-Infected, Symptomatic-Infected) model that encorporated a previously published regional mobility componnent.

The project poster has a thorough descpription and academic information.
